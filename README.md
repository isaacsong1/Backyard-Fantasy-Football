## Intro To Project

- This project is a web application where you can create a fantasy football team and draft players based on characters from the game series `Backyard Football`.
- This project was made to complete the assignment `Phase 2 Project` for the `SE-West-091123` class for the [Flatiron](https://flatironschool.com/) Software Engineering Boot Camp.
- The project was completed using the following: `React`,`JavaScript`, `HTML`, `CSS`, & `Semantic-UI`.


## Dependencies

- The following is needed to run this application: `Node`, `JSON Server`, & `React` .

- You must have access to these dependencies in the directory that you are running this application in. If your environment does not have these requirements, you may install them in this order by going to these websites and following the installation instructions:

- [NPM - Node.JS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node)

- [NPM - JSON Server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server)


## Starting the Application

- Make sure nothing is currently running on `http://localhost:3000` and `http://localhost:3001`.
- Open a terminal window in the main directory of where this project is located on your computer.
- Run `npm install` and then run `json-server --watch db.json`
- It should be running on `http://localhost:3000` and your terminal should look something like this:
- ==============================================

    ![JSON Server running correctly.](./JSON-Server.png "JSON Server")

- ==============================================
- Open another terminal window in the main directory of where this project is located on your computer
- Run `npm start`.
- It should take you to a page that looks like this:
- ==============================================

    ![Log In page of app.](./StartUpScreen.png "Log In Page")

- ==============================================

## Attributions

- The project was completed with collaboration from: `Austin Ohlfs`, `Isaac Song`, and `Wesley Smith.`
- This project was created with combination of skills learned from the `Flatiron` curriculum and our own individual research.
- The data used was locally created based on the game series `Backyard Football` created by `Humongous Entertainment`.
- We used character images owned entirely by `Humongous Entertainment` and its affiliates.

## What I Learned

- `Austin`: The phase 2 project was a great learning experience. This project was more complex than my first vanilla JavaScript project but having a good group with Isaac and Wesley made it all possible. This it the my first react js project that I worked on and in the process learn a lot about the JavaScript library.  Using client-side routing to navigate through the app, and using state variables and local storage to keep or data persistent between users. In the future I plan to use my knowledge from this project to build even more complex apps.
- `Isaac`: I learned how to create a web application from scratch using React and improved my ability to work in groups. More specifically, the project taught me how to use the browser's local storage to allow users to sign in and refresh the page without resetting the user that is logged in. 
- `Wesley`:
